# snapchatbots-baker

Baker's basic code for starting the chatbot project for week 5!

### Setup Repository
1. Click "Use as Template" and use the name "snapchatbots-yourname"
2. Clone from your new repo into your desired folder with terminal
3. Open the project code in VSCode (use `code .` if you can)
4. Open terminal in the VSCode window then run `yarn` to install packages
5. Launch the project with `yarn expo start`


You will not need to setup spotify because I used some dummy data for the tracks
